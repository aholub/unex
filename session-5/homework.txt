Create an array of objects that represent an order (customer info and line items).

Using Javascript, generate a purchase page that lists all the items in that order,
shows the total with 10% tax and $5.00 shipping added.
Also, display the customer shipping information.

Each line item should have a 'delete' button next to it. If it's clicked
indicate that the item is deleted visually (print it in gray, for example, or
remove it altogether from the screen) and don't include that item in the total.

At the bottom of the page, collect the credit-card number and expiration date
(use the <date> element) and submit the order to the server. Don't worry, for now,
about telling the server about the deleted items.
