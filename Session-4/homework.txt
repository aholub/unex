1. Install WordPress on your system using the database names (and database-user
	names) in notes.txt.

2. Create a child theme

3. Implement as much myself-as-web-developer web site as you can. Base it
	on your child theme. Your site should have, at mimimum:

		A landing page

		A gallery page showing a gallery of your work.
		Each gallery section should show the front page of the site, a
		short description, and a link to the site. Also, clicking 
		on the image should also get you to the site. Just use a few real web
		sites for this section---no need to create additional sites.

		A blog with one "article" in it

		An about-me section that includes contact information.

4. Just before handing in the homework, you must backup your Wordpress database
	to a file called backupdb.zip . Put the file in your docroot for the site
	(not usually a good idea, but I need to be able to find it!), and check
	it in with the rest of the site.
