(Set up MySql---Mamp already did that, as will your ISP)

Get Wordpress: https://wordpress.org/download/
	Put it into a docroot directory

The 5-minute install (https://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress):

	Create a database using phpMyAdmin (in Mamp or directly): 

		In Mamp regular: http://localhost:8888/phpMyAdmin/
		In Mamp pro, use the console

		Database:	wordpress
		Collation:	utf8mb4_general_ci

		User: 		wpadmin
		Password:	wppass
		Grant all "global privileges" to this user
	

	Run the install script:
		http://localhost/wp-admin/install.php

	If that doesn't work,
		Rename wp-config-sample.php wp-config.php
		Edit as appropriate
		Run the install script from http://localhost/wp-admin/install.php

Back up your install
	check the docroot into git
	mysqldump --add-drop-table -h localhost -u adminUser  \
					-padminPassword wordpress | bzip2 -c > databaseBackup.zip

Restore
	clone or pull the git repo
	bunzip2 -c databaseBackup.zip | \
					mysql -h localhost -u adminUser -padminPassword wordpress

You can also backup and restore using phpMyAdmin's export and import features

Select theme
	Themes control the look and feel of the menu, sidebar,
	and general page layout. Most themes also come with a default,
	good looking, "landing page."

	I'm using StudioPress.com  AltitudePro on my site at present
	BeaverBuilder also has a simple theme

	You get what you pay for: ***AVOID*** http://themeforest.net

Create a child theme 
	In depth article: https://goo.gl/D2aKpG)
	Official WordPress docs: https://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes

	1. Create a folder in wp-content/themes whose name is your theme name
			(e.g. mytheme-child)
	2. In that folder, create a style.css with the following comment in it:

		/*
		Theme Name: MyTheme Child
		Template: folderNameOfParentTheme

		---------- Everything below this line is optional:
		Description: Twenty Fifteen Child Theme
		Author: John Doe
		Version: 1.0.0

		Theme URI: http://example.com/twenty-fifteen-child/
		Author URI: http://example.com
		License: GNU General Public License v2 or later
		License URI: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html
		Tags: light, dark, two-columns, right-sidebar, responsive-layout, accessibility-ready
		Text Domain: mytheme-child
		*/

	3. In that folder, create a functions.php file that looks like this:

			<?php
			function my_theme_enqueue_styles() {

				// You could put 
				//		@import url("../twentyfifteen/style.css");
				// into your child-theme css file instead of doing the
				// following, but that's way less efficient

					// eg. 'twentyfifteen-style' for the Twenty Fifteen theme.
				$parent_style = 'parent-style'; 

				wp_enqueue_style( $parent_style,
						get_template_directory_uri() . '/style.css' );

				// If you have a additional child style sheets
				// (other than style.css), add them like this:
				//
				//	wp_enqueue_style( 'child-style',
				//	get_stylesheet_directory_uri() . '/style.css',
				//	array( $parent_style ),
				//	wp_get_theme()->get('Version')
				//  );
			}
			add_action( 'wp_enqueue_scripts', 'my_theme_enqueue_styles' );

		Note that there's no ?> (a php close tag) at the end of the file.
