Bundling: I'll demonstrate

	Browserify (http://browserify.org/)
		npm install -g browserify

	Uglify (https://www.npmjs.com/package/uglify-js-harmony)
		npm install -g uglify-js-harmony

	"npm" the "Node package manager" You'll have to install node
	to use it. If you're on the mac,

		- first install homebrew (https://brew.sh)
		- then issue a
			brew install node

	on Windows, get the installer fromn
		https://nodejs.org/en/download/

	I've put a small shell script that I use to bundle things up
	into the class repo. You'll have to modify that for your
	own use, however.

LIGHTSAIL:

Lightsail is by far the easiest portal into Amazon's EC2 system:

	https://amazonlightsail.com/

Set up an account


Here's how you can get your wordpress password if you set up a Wordpress
instance.
	1. Paste the IP address of your blog into your browser.
	2. Choose Manage in the lower right-hand corner.
	3. Choose Login to log in to the admin console.
	4. Use the default user name (user).

	To get the password, you'll need to connect to your instance.
	1. Go back to Lightsail and choose Connect using SSH to connect to
		your WordPress instance.
	2. Type the following:
		cat bitnami_application_password

To hook up to a domain name:
	1. register the domain with a registrar. I like gandi.net
	2. In lightsail main page:
			pick "Create other resources" at the top
			pick DNS Zone
			enter your domain
			note the name servers
			Go back to your registrar and enter those name servers.

	3. To add mail via Google, you'll need to set up "G Suite" account
		(gsuite.google.com). I'll show you in class. Part of that process
		involves adding MX records to your domain. Do that from the
		lightsail window we were just on by clicking "add another".

For file loading, just pulling from git is easiest, but you can also use an
FTP client like CyberDuck (https://cyberduck.io/).
Get your "public key" file from your account page. Then

	- When you "Open Connection", Choose SFTP.
	- Server is the Public IP for your instance (port will be 22)
	- Username is indicated on the "Connect" tab of manage instance
	  Choose the SSH Private Key for the instance (download
	  the Default Key from the accounts page if you don't already
	  have one).

	Bitnami has documentation here to connect to phpmyadmin securely:
	https://docs.bitnami.com/aws/apps/magento/#how-to-access-phpmyadmin

For access the instance's command line, you can SSH into your
instance from the lightsail dashboard, but you can also use
external tools. There are instructions for using PuTTY
(http://www.putty.org/) on the Lightsail site.

to use the mac ssh client,
	- download the private key file from lightsail
	- copy that key to your ~/.ssh directory (if one doesn't exist, create it).
	  If you rename the file to id_rsa, you're done. access your instance
	  with:

		/usr/bin/ssh bitnami@34.197.120.127

	  where the IP address is the one for your instance and the login name
	  (bitnami) is the one that lightsail gave to you.

	- If you already have a ~/.ssh directory with an id_rsa file in it, then
	  copy the .pem file into your ~/.ssh directory, change it's access
	  permissions to make it very restricted (or ssh will balk);

	  	chmod 600 myfile.pem

	  then access the remote system with

	  	/usr/bin/ssh -i ~/.ssh/lightsail.pem bitnami@34.197.120.127

The other alternative if you're particularly paranoid is to use the
ssh-keygen utility to create a public-key, private-key pair, upload
the public key to Amazon, and then proceed as above. ssh-keygen will
put the key pair into ~/.ssh for you.
