Redo your checkout and resume pages in bootstrap,
adding a navigation bar if you don't already have one.
If you can do something in bootstrap (such as a drop-down), I want
you to do it in bootstrap, not raw HTML.

On the checkout page, you should have large box on the left that
holds the line items and a "sidebar" on the right that holds the
customer information and the total. Each line item should be 
laid out using three columns: description, price, quantity.
Use a drop-down to select the quantity (between 1 and 10)
All of these should move around appropriately as the screen
changes size.

Ideally, I want this all done dynamically from data you load from
the server. However, if you don't have that working, yet, then just
create a static page where the line-item information, total, etc is all
hard coded into the page. That is, for this assignment, I'm more interested
in you using bootstrap correctly than I am in you getting the
JavaScript right. I'd suggest doing the whole thing without (much)
JavaScript, first, then redo the assignment to lay out automatically from
fetched data. If you do that, put a v1 and v2
subdirectories into your docroot so that you can hand in both versions.

You may layout your resume as you wish, but again, it should
work correctly when resized to cell-phone sizes.

Do not use any @media tags.
Use Bootstrap to do the resizing as required.
